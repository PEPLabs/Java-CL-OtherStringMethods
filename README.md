# other String Methods Lab

## Pre-Requisites
You are expected to review the `String Basics` written lecture prior to working on this lab.

## Description
In this exercise, you will practice looking at Java documentation to further your understanding how to use Strings. 

## Completing the Lab
You will be editing the file `OtherStringMethods.java`. This file can be found under the `src/main/java` package. Review the file's code and code comments for further instructions.

You will also need to open up Java's official documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html as a reference for this lab. Once you open the website, scroll down to the "Method Summary" section to find the relevant methods you'll need to use. 

Tasks to complete within the `OtherStringMethods.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `partOfString` so that it returns the correct string value.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `compareLexigraphically` so that it returns the correct int value.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `splitStringIntoMultipleStrings` so that it returns the correct string array value.

## Running Tests
If you look within the `src/test/java` folder, you will find the Java class `OtherStringMethodsTest.java`. The `src/test/java` folder will contain your test files.  

To run the tests, click on the Testing tab (test beaker icon on the left-hand side) and run the test cases by using the "Run Test" button (play icon). Please ensure that you do not already have the program running.

You can optionally run the program for manual testing by switching to the file named `Main.java` under the `src/main/java` package and clicking the "Run Java" button (play icon) on the top-right of VSCode.
